# NCAA Player Value Radar Visualizations

This repository contains a Python-based workflow for generating **player value radar charts** for NCAA men’s basketball.  
The project combines custom analytics with interactive visualizations to evaluate player impact across multiple dimensions.

Static PNG exports are optimized for social media distribution, while interactive HTML versions allow users to hover, explore, and interpret each metric in greater detail.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw player statistics into **clear, interpretable, and visually compelling radar charts** that highlight:

- Offensive contribution
- Defensive impact
- Efficiency and decision-making
- Role-adjusted player value

Each player radar is generated from a consistent analytical framework and published in two formats:

- **PNG** – for sharing on platforms like Twitter
- **Interactive HTML** – for deeper exploration via hover tooltips and zoom

The interactive versions are automatically hosted using **GitHub Pages**.
